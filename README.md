#### ⚙️ (wip) changing macroquad thin game engine to bevy

## Problem Decomposition

The task is to create a simple ball-and-bar game where the player controls a bar to bounce a ball and avoid it falling off the screen. The game includes scoring, hearts, and increasing difficulty by adding milestones for extra hearts and bar width.

**Main Features**:
- **Ball Movement**: The ball moves across the screen and bounces off walls and the player's bar.
- **Bar Movement**: The player controls a bar that can move left or right to keep the ball in play.
- **Score System**: The player earns a score by bouncing the ball off the bar, with additional milestones that grant hearts.
- **Hearts**: The player starts with 3 hearts, which are lost when the ball falls off the screen. Losing all hearts ends the game.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the player runs out of hearts, and the player can press "R" to restart.

- [x] Ball moves and bounces off walls and bar.
- [x] Player controls a bar using left and right arrow keys.
- [x] Score is updated when the ball bounces off the bar.
- [x] Hearts are deducted when the ball falls below the bar.
- [x] Milestones for awarding hearts and increasing bar width.
- [x] Game over when no hearts are left.

- **Controls**  
  - Use the **left** and **right** arrow keys to move the bar.
  - Press **R** to restart the game when it’s over.
